# The Task
You have been given a file with N number of integers, stored as characters.
Complete the following tasks ***in order***.
You may use whatever methods you would like, ***unless a specific logic is given***.

- [x] Read all values into linked list nodes
- [x] Remove any copies from the list
- [x] Print all values from the new linked list to an output file called **initialList.txt**
- [x] Add a node to the back of the list (user terminal prompt)
- [x] Insert a node in the list (user terminal prompted value and index)
- [x] Print this list to the **addedList.txt** file on a new line
- [x] Reverse this linked list ***iteratively***
- [x] Print this list to output file **firstReversedList.txt**
- [ ] Read all values of that list into a new array
- [ ] Copy the values of that array (using the array), dynamically allocating memory
- [ ] Reverse the copied array
- [ ] Print both arrays to a file called **arrayForwardBackward.txt** on their own lines
- [ ] Compare the two arrays to see if they are palindromes
- [ ] Print the result to output file **isPalindrome.txt** (1! A Palindrome or 0! Not a Palindrome)
- [ ] Retrieve the two largest numbers from the array
- [ ] Add them together and get the result
- [ ] Count the number of 1s in that number
- [ ] Print all the numbers from the previous 3 steps to **numbers.txt**, each with a label
- [ ] Sort the values of the copied array in ascending order
- [ ] Print this array to **sortedArray.txt**
- [ ] Use ***recursive*** binary search to find an element (user prompted)
- [ ] Print the element and its index to the console
- [ ] Remove that element from the array
- [ ] Feed those values into a new linked list
- [ ] Print the new list to **newLinkedList.txt**
- [ ] Use ***recursion*** to reverse that list
- [ ] Print this list to **finalList.txt**
- [ ] Relax.
